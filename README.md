# Introduction
The jupyter notebook tutorials in this package complement the statistics/machine learning lectures given at the European School of High-Energy Physics. The tutorials provide a reasonably gentle, yet I hope highly instructive, introduction to a few important ideas in frequentist and Bayesian statistics as well as machine learning. Both fields are vast and increasingly complex. However, both contain ideas that are foundational and, therefore, remain valid. 

The tutorials implement solutions in Python to some of the more involved exercises presented in the lectures. 

The tutorials depend on a few well-known Python packages: 
  * __numpy__   (numerical analysis and array manipulation)
  * __pandas__  (data table manipulation)
  * __scipy__   (scientific comouting)
  * __matplotlib__ (plotting)
  
In addition, the machine learning tutorials make use of  
  * __scikit-learn__ (and easy to use machine learning toolkit)
